											is.
										</li>
										<li>
											Have facilitated unhindered access to the stop cock.
										</li>
										<li>
											Have ensured that the stop cock is in good working order.
										</li>
									</ul>

										abortive visit occur due to one or any of the above
										requirements not being met. In addition to this, if the stop
										cock is not in good working order and you ask our plumber to
										go ahead regardless, we will not be liable for any damage or
										consequential loss as a result of this whatsoever. You may
										wish to discuss your liability to costs for repair to mains
										water pipes or equipment serving your property with your

										collect any outstanding balance for work or other fees
										incurred (Such as missed appointment and cancellation fees)
										as per section 1.2. Where we are undertaking work for which
										a quote has been accepted by you, we will usually ask for a
										deposit. The balance of the work is payable within 5 days of
										completion of the work.

									<p>
										It costs us up to £100 to provide you with a quote, in fuel
										costs, vehicle wear and tear, staff wages, and IT costs and

										however we will not make any charge to your card at this
										point. As long as you inform us of your decision to either
										accept or reject our quote within 14 days of issue, we will
										delete your card details and no charge will be made. If we
										do not receive a decision from you, an administration charge
										of £25.00 will be charged to your credit or debit card. This
										fee helps us recoup some money towards the cost of having
										visited your premises to provide you with a quote.

										are any changes to the nature or extent of the requested
										work. This may apply to both labour and materials. However
										the quote will not be amended without consultation with the
										client.
									</p>
									<p>
										1.3 Time frames are guidelines and although we will
										endeavour to complete the work in the time frame intimated,
										we cannot be held responsible for extra time taken to due to
										unforeseen circumstances. Similarly, it may be that by
										employing extra resources we can finish a project more
										quickly than estimated, in which case the price of the quote
										will still remain the same.
									</p>
									<p>
										1.4 It is not normally necessary to remove radiators, but if
										their removal is requested, it can be done for an additional
										charge. This charge will also cover their subsequent
										replacement.
									</p>
									<p>
										1.5 We may on occasion request that tools be left on site
										overnight. The client reserves the right to decline such
										requests.
									</p>
									<p>1.6 Quotes are valid for 28 days from issue.</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h4>2. Damage and Complaints.</h4>
									<p>

									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											To remove valuable and/or fragile items from the areas to
											be decorated.
										</li>
										<li>To remove pictures and other wall-hangings.</li>
										<li>To remove electrical goods.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Assistance can be provided with the repositioning and/or
										removal of bulky furniture items and white goods, but will
										incur an additional charge. We reserve the right to decline
										to move white goods if the condition or position of the
										plumbing may incur a higher than normal risk of damage to
										the equipment or the property. We reserve the right to
										decline to move particularly heavy or bulky items if they
										present a higher than accepted health and safety risk.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.1 We are usually happy to do favours for our clients over
										and above our quotations. However, past experience has
										proved that we are liable for any favours. Therefore we ask
										the client to sign a waiver for each job performed absolving
										us of any responsibility for any work undertaken that is not
										written into the quote. I.e. if it is not in the quote it is
										not covered by London Property Engineers Limited.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.2 Where items cannot be covered or protected, but could
										easily have been removed, we will request that they are
										removed before work commences. We cannot be held liable for
										damage to such items if they are not removed.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.3 We will take every possible precaution to ensure that
										all vulnerable areas and any objects left in the work area
										are carefully and thoroughly covered and/or masked. However,
										there will always remain a very small risk of overspill or
										dust getting past these precautions. In the rare event of
										overspill, dust or other cosmetic damage, we will endeavour
										to ensure that it is satisfactorily cleaned.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.4 We may take photographs of your property or complete a
										pre-existing damage form prior to the start of the project.
										In the unlikely event that we do damage your property, you
										will be covered by our insurance for the full amount.
										However, spurious claims that we can dispute with photo
										evidence or written agreement will incur a £50 charge per
										complaint to cover administration costs.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.5 In the event of breakage or damage to the property
										London Property Engineers Limited will notify the client
										immediately and set out steps to remedy the situation. The
										client must notify London Property EngineersLimited, in
										writing within 24 hours of an alleged breakage or damage
										caused by our employees.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.6 The client agrees to pay the invoice for work a maximum
										of 5 days after completion of the project. In the event that
										the client is unhappy with the standard of workmanship, the
										correct complaints procedure as show in these terms and
										condition must be followed.
									</p>
									<p>
										2.7 All materials purchased for, or on behalf of the client,
										remain the property of London Property Engineers Limited
										until payment of the final invoice by the client to London
										Property Engineers Limited. In the event of dispute, the
										client agrees to allow access to the property to a
										representative of London Property Engineers Limited to
										retrieve all materials that remain the property of the
										company.

										accepts that the project has been completed to their
										satisfaction and payment in full is due.
									</p>
									<p>
										5.2 London Property Engineers Limited is willing, at the
										request of the client, prior to agreement of the Terms and
										conditions to allow the client to retain the sum of 5% of
										the total invoice for 1 week. This is to cover circumstances
										beyond the control of either party, which may require a
										commitment from London Property Engineers Limited to return
										to the property for small repairs. The sum of 95% of the
										invoice is to be paid 24 hours after completion of the
										project.
									</p>
									<p>
										5.3 London Property Engineers Limited is happy to provide
										invoices for businesses and individuals. However, payment is
										due within the time-scales as stated in the Terms and
										Conditions and the amount, unless amended by London Property
										Engineers Limited, is fixed in the quotation. Therefore, the
										client is liable for payment, regardless of whether an
										invoice has been received.
									</p>
									<p>
										5.4 The client agrees that the project is complete when the
										items on the quotation have been completed.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>

									</p>
									<p>

									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>SECTION C – PAYMENT</h3>
									<p>
										London Property EngineersLimited will not tolerate
										aggressive behaviour, rude behaviour, racism, nationalism,
										sexism, homophobia or ageism directed towards any of its
										staff or contractors.
									</p>
									<p>
										London Property Engineers Limited will not tolerate
										aggressive behaviour, rude behaviour, racism, nationalism,
										sexism, homophobia or ageism directed towards any of its
										staff or contractors. If you choose to settle your account
										using a credit card, a charge of 2.5% of the account value
										will be levied – this fee is not retained by London Property
										Engineers Limited but passed on to the credit card issuing
										company. Please note that the same applies to American
										express card payments.
									</p>
									<p>
										For projects scheduled to take more than 1 week to complete.
										For final payment we accept all major credit / debit Cards
										or BACS transfers
									</p>
									<p>
										Our engineers are permitted to accept cash, Please check
										with London Property Engineers prior to the services been
										carried out with a member of staff – to pay for your deposit
										or completed job you must pay London Property Engineers
										Limited directly. Your account will remain outstanding until
										such time as London Property Engineers Limited receives
										payment directly by either a debit / credit card, Cash or by
										BACS transfer.
									</p>
									<p>
										Engineers sent by London Property Engineers to undertake
										work on our behalf are not permitted to accept work directly
										from you. Should you engage the services of any London
										Property Engineers Engineer to undertake such work at any
										time, a fee of 3 times thatengineers monthly salary will
										become payable by you to London Property Engineers as a
										recruitment service fee.
									</p>
									<p>
										The client agrees to pay the invoice a maximum of 24 hours
										after completion of the project. <br />

										A small minority of clients choose to ignore calls, are
										evasive, request multiple invoices, obfuscate or are
										unavailable for contact after the project has been completed
										and payment is due. London Property Engineers Limited
										reserves the right to process the outstanding invoice and
										receive payment within 5 days of completion. The client
										agrees that card or account information provided to London
										Property Engineers Limited, may be used to process the
										outstanding amount. London Property Engineers Limited are
										fully compliant with the Data Protection Act in this matter.
										<br />
										Should the outstanding balance not be settled within 5 days,
										London Property Engineers Limited reserve the right to levy
										an administration charge of £80.00
										<br />
										In the event that London Property Engineers Limited cannot
										recover any outstanding amount after 10 working days, we
										will employ the services of a debt collection agency. The
										client accepts that the debt collection agency will increase
										the outstanding amount to cover their costs – this fee is
										levied as soon as the debt is passed from us to them and
										usually amounts to 33% of the cost of the invoice – it is
										therefore strongly in your interests to settle your invoice
										as soon as possible to avoid these extra costs. Once the
										debt passes from us to the debt collection agency, we have
										no further involvement in the account and cannot reverse the
										process or any associated fees.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>SECTION D – COMPLAINTS PROCEDURE</h3>
									<p>
										London Property Engineers are committed to ensuring that our
										customers are satisfied with our service. If for any reason
										you are not, you should follow our complaints procedure as
										set out below:
									</p>
									<p>
										Step 1 : There are two ways to complain which are in writing
										via email or in a written letter to our head office. The
										details for both are provided below. Email:
										complaints@lpi-trade.co.uk Write a letter to: London
										Property Engineers Ltd, 145-157 St John Street, London, EC1V
										4PY

										<br />

										Step 2 : Once we have received your letter or email we will
										respond via email or written letter within 21 days
										explaining the situation from our point of view and what we
										think will be the best way to move forward. If the complaint
										is not of a complex nature you may receive a phone call from
										a manager to discuss and rectify in a quicker time period.
										Please note if we have used an external contractor it may be
										that we put you in touch with him or her directly to
										discuss, handle and rectify the situation.

										<br />
										Step 3 : We endeavour to make sure that all of our customers
										are happy. Our business depends on customer satisfaction.
										<br />
										If after the response you have received from us in step 2
										you are not happy, you have the right to complain again
										stating why you are not happy using the same channels in
										step 1. We will then further investigate you complaint and
										give you another response. This letter we refer to as
										“deadlock”. This will be our final position on the matter.
										<br />
										If the balance of your account has already been charged to
										your card, and we agree after having completed our
										investigation that you are due a refund, we will issue this
										refund with 5 days of the date of completion of the
										investigation.
										<br />
										If your complaint is about a service that we have provided
										to you, you must:
										<br />
										Pay the undisputed part of your account (unless the balance
										has been collected from your card already).
										<br />
										Let us know within 48 hours of completion of the work.
										<br />
										Complaints received that have not followed this complaints
										procedure will not be investigated.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h4>Retesting</h4>
									<p>
										On occasions Certificates, Reports and inspections may fail
										to meet minimum British &/or legal standards or requirements
										to deem the property or appliance safe. If this occurs we
										will let you know via email, telephone or state the problems
										on the report. We offer remedial services to rectify
										problems and in most cases offer a free new “passed” or
										“Safe” certificate or inspection for free. This is at the
										discretion of our administration team and in some
										circumstances a charge may be applicable. If you choose to
										get your remedial works done with another company legally we
										will have to come out and retest (if you choose to use us to
										retest) the whole of the property/ appliances. If this is
										the case the full charge of the report/ certificate or
										inspection will be charged, unless a discount has been
										agreed in advance.
